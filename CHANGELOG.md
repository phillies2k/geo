ChangeLog
=========

**v1.0.0**
* initial version

**v1.1.1**
* Removed environment dependency from coordinate. A coordinate no longer exists in only one environment. Instead metric
  calculation methods now require an environment to work. You're now able to shift coordinates to several environments.

**v1.2.0**
* Enhanced geo coordinate functionality to be able to convert and set from and to different formats of public coordinate
  representation types, like DMS.
